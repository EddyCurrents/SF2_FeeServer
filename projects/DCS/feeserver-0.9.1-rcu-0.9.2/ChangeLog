ChangeLog for FeeServer package. This will focus on the ControlEngine.
Also see files README_v* in the feeserver subfolder for a history on 
the FeeServer core software.

04.09.2007 release of FeeServer_v0-9-1_RCU-v0-9-2
	- Note: cvs tag of the branch is for some accident FeeServer_v0-9-2_RCU-v0-9-2
	- based on core version 0.9.1
	
	Logging
	  - INFO log level removed from core default log level
	  - log level for initialization is 'Info', after init changed to
	    'Warning'
	  - better filtering of warnings for access failures

	State Machines
	- support for temporary states and guard structure added
	- Handler for USER defined states added to dispatcher, dynamic
	  transition handling implemented
	- high-level commands CE_GET_TRANSITIONS, CE_GET_STATENAME, CE_GET_STATES, 
	  and CE_GET_STATE implemented for devices
	
	MsgBuffer
	- msg buffer access encapsulated completely in separate class
	  DCSCMsgBuffer(dev_msgbuffer.[c,h]pp)
	- msgbuffer simulation functionality moved from CErcu to DCSCMsgBuffer
	- check of msgBufferInterface driver and intelligent handling of failures

	TPC/RCU
	- MAIN state machine corrected according to the lates agreements
	  - no state 'RUNNING'
	  - CONF_DDL can be entered by START_DAQ_CONF
	  - CONF_DDL terminated by START_DAQ_CONF
	  - intermediate state RAMPING_DOWN as part of GO_IDLE
	- ramping of FECs power on/off added to dev_rcu, FECs are switched
	  with at least 1 second delay between each other
	- switching of FECs indicated by intermediate state RAMPING_UP/DOWN
	- apply final naming scheme for FECs if server name follows the naming
	  rule TPC-FEE_x_y_z. Note: the naming scheme has been aggreed on by
	  PBM, Luciano and Christian in June 2007 and is the same on A and C
	  side. The last FEC in branch A is no 00, and than it counts the branch
	  A down and branch B up. The first FEC in branch B is therefore no 9, 10
	  or 12, depending on the total no of FECs
	- ACTEL control device added

	Commands
	- command set version 5:
	  - RCU configuration and ACTEL device commands
	  - RCU_READ_FW_VERSION added
	- command set version 4: two new commands CE_GET_STATE and
	  CE_GET_STATE added
	- FEE_CONFIGURE improved: scanning of hardware address and printout,
	  history of pending FEE_CONFIGURE commands

	Misc
	- CE_FORCE_CH_UPDATE updates all services beginning with specified string
	- service update is stopped during command execution
	- update of FECs during ramping	
	- generic high-level command handling applied to existing handling,
	  additional high-level commands added
            FEESVR_SET_FERO_DATA32 (converted)
            FEESVR_SET_FERO_DATA16
            FEESVR_SET_FERO_DATA8
            CE_FORCE_CH_UPDATE
            CEDBG_SET_BUF_PRINT_SIZE
            CEDBG_EN_SERVICE_UPDATE
            CEDBG_SET_SERVICE_VALUE
            CE_SET_LOGGING_LEVEL
            CE_RELAX_CMD_VERS_CHECK
	  
19.06.2007 release of feeserver-0.8-rcu-0.9
	- core updated to 0.8.1
	- CE++ interface finnished, fully object oriented CE
	- tpc and phos CE converted to CE++
	- support and examples for TRD and FMD added
	- CE publishs also int and char channels
	- Sub-device handling implemented
	- ACTIONS can be send to all sub-device state machines
	- user defined states added to StateMachine, flexible translation scheme
	  by CEStateMapper object
	- rpm support added
	- RCU CE
	  - detector flavors derive from RCU CE base class
	  - flexible branch layout
	  - detector specific FEC implementation inherits from FEC base class
	  - RCU registers published as int channels, currently AFL and ERRST
	  - switch for 5/8-bit SlowControl interface foreseen, 8-bit access 
            has to be implemented
	
13.06.2007 feeserver-0.8-rcu-0.9-beta5
	- updated to feeserver core 0.8, see feeserver/README_v0.8.txt
	- support and examples for TRD and FMD added
	- code documentation
	- bugfix: FEC pos >= 4 monitoring fixed (CErcu::IsFECposActive)
	- RCUControlEngine starts in state STANDBY (ON), more inconsistencies
	  in states and functionality in CErcu and CEfec corrceted 
	
08.06.2007 feeserver-0.7-rcu-0.9-beta4	
	- bugfix: crash in the feeserver core in the cleanUp of the item list. 
	  Memory for the item and item name is freed, additional memory is now
	  allocated in RegisterService
	- The CE is fully C++, customized CE's can be derived from the ControlEngine
	  base class which handles all CE API entries.
	- services of FEC's are entirely registered and handled by the FEC devices.
	- FEC's are turned to state failure if there was a repeated access error,
	  this stops services publishing and also the error messages
	- value range of FEC services: a range can be specified for FEC services, the
	  FEC goes to ERROR state and is turned off if a value is outside the range.
	- implementation of the TPC FEC: TEMP limit 55 degrees
	- dummy access of FEC registers via the SlowControl bus directly after power
	  up of the FEC. According to Roberto this is necessary to bring the 
	  SlowControl into a defined state.
        - temporary for the TPC test Jun 07: write access to the CSR0 before each
	  register access. This sounds like a desperate try, yeah.
	- CEdevice: handler for entering ERROR state added 
	
04.06.2007 feeserver-0.7-rcu-0.9-beta3
	- added dummy access to FEC right after switching on in order to bring I2C bus
	  into defined state
	- handling of FEE_CONFIGURE command moved to RCUControlEngine, 
	  transition to error state if failed

04.06.2007 feeserver-0.7-rcu-0.9-beta2
	- completely re-worked CErcu device
	  - FEC services controlled by FEc devices
	  - CErcuSim class implements RCU dummy functionality
	  - servive functionality moved from rcu_service to CErcu (dev_rcu.cpp)
	  - NOTE: handling of additional services for RCU registers is currently
	    disabled
	- CEfecTPC and TPCBranchLayout are the default setup definitions
	- all DIM devices get a set function for the STATE channel in order
	  to switch on/off
	- access error flag for FECs: cards are turned to ERROR state after
	  repeated access error of the same register
	
31.05.2007 feeserver-0.7-rcu-0.9-beta1
	- object oriented FEC handling -> FECs as sub-devices to RCU device
	- reset of the Altro bus ErrSt register before RCU sequencer execution
	- internal changes: object oriented command (issue) handling started and
	  implemented for RCU device
	- Int and string service types added, all DIM devices get STATE and 
	  STATENAME channel.
	- STATE IDs of MAIN state machine adapted to PVSS IDs
	
15.05.2007 FeeServer-0.7-rcu-0.8.9-dev
	- float and string DIM channels added to CE framework
	- channel STATENAME added for CEDimDevices

	- TPC configuration working session Apr 02-04 2007
	- updated to DIM 16.09
	- bugfixes:
	  - dcscMsgBufferInterface: return value of rcuMultipleReadExt
	    corrected to be word count
	  - service update: disable reading of active FEC list if service
	    update disabled
	  - command handling: RCU_READ/WRITE_MEMBLOCK return correct byte count
	  - command handling: FEE_CONFIGURE corrected word counter for nested
	    commands
	- added LockGuard in order to protect RCU memory access in concurrent threads
	  (service update and RCU memory access commands)
	
22.07.2006 FeeServer-0.7-rcu-0.8.5
	- command set version 3: access commands for all RCU registers added
	- the command definition rcu_issue.h does not contain function definitions

	- build scheme has changed to comply with the autotools rules
	  have a look into the README
	- dim has become a real autotools package, the shipped version
	  is used only if there is no dim library found in the system or if
	  explicitly stated
	- work arounds for RCU firmware version of May 05 (unfortunately 
	  there is no real version tag) can be enabled by --enable-ancient05

	    (e.g. shell command execution, feeserver update); by default disabled
	  - DIM package updated to version 15.20
	  - crashes on normal PCs in the DIM package fixed, most likely due to the handling of threads in the DIM library
	- changes in FeeServer core 0.7.3 (see also README_v0.7.txt in feeserver folder)
	  - default log level set from environment variable FEE_LOG_LEVEL if existent
	  - error handler for DIM messages implemented to catch messages from DIM system and

	   - reading of default services
	   - reading of currently valid FECs
	   - read rcu instruction/pattern memory (not yet implemented)
	   - read/ write rcu memory (not yet implemented)
	- the valid FECs are configured at startup from the system variable FEESERVER_FEC_MONITOR if
	  available; for now format is a string like "0101" where each 1 enables the corresponding FEC, 
	  all missing are treated as zero, the above exaple enables thus FEC #2 and #4 while all the 
	  others are disabled
	- configure: default install directory set to the project directory itself
	- the README_v* files for the core software have been moved to the feeserver subfolder
